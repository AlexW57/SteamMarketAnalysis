# SteamMarketAnalysis
The goal of this project is to analyze popular games available on Steam to detect some of the trends in the gaming industry. The program parses data from the steam store website and calculates game industry trends to help predict the future of the PC gaming market. Currently, I track the genres of the top 50 popular upcoming games and top 50 sellers on the Steam Store. I then use this data to determine what the most popular genres are at the moment and it is displayed in a graph. I plan to add more to this project very soon. I am going to add algorithms to predict the success of future games based on what genres they fit into and I will add new graphical displays to showcase new data that I gather. These new displays will use game icons that were parsed from the Steam store as well to make the design easier on the eyes and the games more recognizable.
